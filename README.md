### Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineering student who like to help people achieve their personal goals 😀. In the moment, I am currently studying at [Univates][univates], but I also completed my technician at [EEEPE][eeepe]👨‍🎓.

My hobbies are write to [Quack Redação][quack]🖋, watch live coding at YouTube and Twitch TV and build simple projects to test a concept, an idea, solve a problem or just for fun.

I'm currently unemployed, but I keep studying and perfecting my skills.

My favorite languages are:

- Ruby 💎
- JavaScript/Typescript
- PHP 🐘
- Python 🐍
- Shell script 🐚
- Batch Script 💾

My favorite web projects:

- [RaccoonPo (Jokenpo)][RaccoonPo] [source][RaccoonPo source]
- [Rock Paper Scissors in Vanilla JS][rock-paper-scissors-js] [source][rock-paper-scissors-js source]

I really like to learn and also new challenges. I like to teach too, even if I don't have many students.

Let's change the world together? 🌎
